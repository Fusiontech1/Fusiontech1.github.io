		<h2>Our love and passion for typography reached an all time high in *DATA REDACTED* when the company was founded. We started small and have grown massively however we are still humble! By *DATA REDACTED* we started collaborating with other tech and typography based companies in order to bring you better products from all sides. Our opinions on Comic Sans have stayed the same since it first launched and we were waiting on technology to advance before we could bring a solution and as you know, now is the time! You don't need to dwell on this page any further as what's in the past is in the past and we should focus on the future!</h2>
